The folder contains the synthetic data generated from implicit numerical integration of the WG model in the principal space.

Data is normalized between -1.0 and 1.0.

The 'X' label contains the input data and the 'y' label contains the output data.

dstate contains the void ratio and plastic strain increments as output, while dstress contains the stress increment as output.

Both dstate and dstress include the void ratio, stress, plastic strain, strain and strain increment as inputs.

"dstate-04-plas.dat" and "dstress-04-plas.dat" include data from random loading paths with maximum strain magnitude of 4e-4 in
each loading step. Only the plastic steps are recorded.

"dstate-16-plas.dat" and "dstress-16-plas.dat" include data from random loading paths with maximum strain magnitude of 16e-4 in
each loading step. Only the plastic steps are recorded.
